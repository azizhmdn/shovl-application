## About the Project
‘Shovl’ is a tool that farmers can use to predict crop yield. It uses machine learning algorithms to predict crop yield based on user and live weather input. We planned to start this project by predicting from crops that have quick harvest time such as rice and corn. ‘Shovl’ is born because of our concern with the farmers who are in danger of crop failure.

## Business Understanding
We came up with this idea because we saw news of farmers who are in danger of crop failure due to heavy rainfall.  We thought of an idea to warn the farmers of sudden changes to the weather and predict the crop yield from that weather condition. By using the idea of predicting the crop yield, the users can still use our tool even when the weather is in normal condition. We also thought that by using crop yield prediction it will increase the business side for the user since they will receive some insights about the profit that they will be making.
